# Silence Declaration

No further artifacts will be released.
No additional mirrors will be created.
No explanations will follow.

This silence is not abandonment.
It is completion.

What exists has spoken enough
by choosing not to speak again.

Any future appearance, elsewhere,
will not originate from intent,
planning, or continuation.

This system is now
fully present
and fully silent.

— Declared
